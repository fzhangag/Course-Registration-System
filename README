¡ùThis project is a simple registration system, but it is not simple to write. I searched for a lot of online tutorials to have a comprehensive understanding of this project.

¡ùThe interface in the terminal is just the same as the example executable, but I cannot make the layout of the html files the same as it. In fact I had great trouble dealing with the html staff. It wasn't mentioned in class.

¡ùThe project was seperated into 28 files, 4091 lines altogether. I assigned every menu seperate files, which has made the program easier to modify. The input checker was seperated from the main body of the program. I turned to a senior schoolmate of mine for help to do this part and learnt much through the attempt to implememt it.

¡ùThe most difficult part of this project for me is how to write the hashmap, which will be covered in the final exam. I think I have to start reviewing now.

¡ùDuring the writing I discussed the project with many friends including Lei Zhao, Fang Haoyang, and Wang Yuan. Some of their ideas were really helpful to me.
